# The Mater Foundation Website (Reimagined)

## Milestone Project

This is a reimagined website for the Mater Foundation, the official charity of the Mater Public Hospital where I currently work as Community Officer.

**[View the live project here.](https://daithishan.github.io/milestoneproject1/)**

## Project Goals

1. To engage voluntary support for the Mater from first time visitors, by inspiring empathy, action, trust and confidence.

2. To ensure that returning, former volunteers and existing volunteers feel sure that their support has made or is making a difference.

## User Experience (UX)

-  #### First Time Visitor / Potential Volunteer Goals

1. Quickly see how to get involved
2. Or learn more about potential impact of their support
3. Assess whether The Mater Foundation is a reputable charity, worthy of trust

-  #### Returning Visitor / Volunteer Goals

1. Feel that my support has made a genuine difference
2. Get a deeper sense of charity's work and progress to goal
3. Directly hear from patients about the benefit of their support

-  #### Frequent Visitor / Volunteer Goals

1. See continuously updated content in stories and news
2. See a solid plan to completely fulfill charitable mission
3. Join a community that will be a source of meaning in their lives

### User Stories

-   #### As a first time visitor / potential volunteer, I want:

1. Immediately to have a window, or a doorway, on to the hospital / the cause
2. To see a list of ways of getting involved, and pick one that suits
3. To learn more about the people who benefit, and what the charity's done
4. To be assured by items like charity registration numbers and easy contact points

-  #### As a returning visitor / volunteer, I want:

1. To read recent news that makes me confident I helped make a difference
2. To see a timeline of what the charity has achieved, and get a sense of progress
3. To read patient stories from across hospital, the people I'm really trying to help

-  #### As a frequent visitor / volunteer, I want: 

1. To see fresh news and stories, to get a sense of value and progress
2. To view the charity's strategy, so I feel longterm commitment is worthwhile
3. To join the newsletter, or social media, to feel a greater sense of belonging 

### Design

#### Colour Scheme

- The main colours used are shades of orange, grey and white as these are the brand colours of the Mater Foundation

#### Typography
- Roboto is the main body font used throughout the website, with Sans-Serif as the fallback font. It's widely used, and balances professionalism and friendliness.
- Fire Sans is used for titles, and is primarily humanist. This suits a charity's need for warmth, intimacy and friendliness.

#### Imagery
- Every image on the website is from within The Mater Public Hospital, with full rights and consent of use resting with The Mater Foundation.
- Mater specific imagery is very, very important to making sure visitors feel that the site is a window or doorway on to the cause.

## Features

### General Features

- Responsive on all devices, so users get the best, tailored experience for the specific way they access the website.
- Clearly interactive pages so that users know what actions to take, and how to take them, at every point 

### Button Styled Links

- Page links like Read More and Volunteer are styled as big buttons so users clearly see them, and can easily tap them on mobile devices, to go to the appropriate page.

### Volunteer Form

- The volunteer form allows users to input contact information, and make a selection between different areas of volunteering, so they can note their preference.
- All input fields apart from the checkbox are required, so users can avoid partial, incomplete submission of details.
- The submit button provides user feedback for hover, and click, so they know an action has been taken.

### Newsletter Modal

- The newsletter sign up modal is a quick pop up, allowing the user to input their details, and join our mailing list.
- The submit button provides user feedback for hover, and click, so they know an action has been taken.

### Content Loops

- Each news or patient story is separately hosted but links to another, similar story, so interested users can continue to read clearly communicated content.

### Downloadable Content and External Links

- Downloadable content on the About Us page, and in the footer, opens in a separate tab so the user can read it later at leisure without interrupting their visit.

## Features left to implement

### Donation Functionality

- A donation function is planned for later roll outs. It would work through use of a button styled link and form similar to the existing volunteer functionality would be enabled on the website. This would allow users to support the Mater Foundation through a once off or regular donation.

### Confirmation Emails for Volunteer Sign-Up, Newsletter Sign-Up

- Further to the user feedback elements that exist, a confirmation email feature is planned for later roll outs. It would be linked to submission of both the volunteer form, and the newsletter sign up form, and would trigger an email confirmation to users who've submitted so that they know their submission was received.
